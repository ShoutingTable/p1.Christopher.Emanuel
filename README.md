**Issues with the current design (The Good)**
  - Nothing

**Issues with current design (The Bad)**
  - The star has to be replaced with a number. I do not know what a star means. 
  - The amount of space that is between the buttons seems unnecessary.
  - The panel that tells me which floor I am going to is too far.
  - Too much space between buttons and floor panel.

**Common Uses**
  - Avoiding Stairs
  - Getting from the first floor to the second floor
  - Getting from the second floor to the first floor (not so good)
  - Transporting items
  - Transporting people

**Common Sequence of Action**
  - Press button
  - Wait for elevator
  - Get in elevator
  - Press floor button
  - Look up to make sure you are going to right floor
  - Exit the elevator

The elevator only provides feedback when arriving to the selected floor

**Common Mistakes**
  - Not realize which floor you are going to (the star being the confusion)
